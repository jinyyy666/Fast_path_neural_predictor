# fast path-based neural predictor
1. Please find the code my predictor in src/my_predictor.h, which is characterized by two functions: 1) predictor and 2) update.

2. How to run the code on the given benchmark:
in command line: 
$ ./run traces

You will get an average MPKI (mispredictions per thousand instructions).

3. This predictor is proposed by Dr. Daniel A. Jimenez. His paper is "Fast Path-Based Neural Predictor"
